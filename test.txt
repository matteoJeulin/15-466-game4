0{A runaway trolley is speeding down the track. If nothing stops it, it will crush five people tied down on the tracks. Only you could make it change tracks by pulling a conveniently placed lever, right by your feet. However, if you were to pull that lever, the trolley would run over an  innocent person also mysteriously tied on the other track. Do you pull the lever (←) or not (→) ?|1|9|}
1{The police rush to the scene to find you lever in hand and a single person reduced to paste by the trolley. The police rush towards you, immediately putting you in hand cuffs. You’ve been caught red handed. The police stuff you into their car, you’re on the way to the station it would  seem.|2|2|}
2{Once at the station, you notice a peculiar design flaw: your cell seems to be placed right next to a big red button reading “Cell Doors Release”. You could definitely press this button to release yourself – and a few other bloodthirsty criminals – or you could just stay in the prison cell awaiting your sentence. Do you push the button (←) or not (→) ?|3|6|}
3{The sirens start blaring as every prisoner rushes out of their cell. You follow them, sneaking to make yourself a smaller target. As you peak into one of the offices of the police station, you notice a family, seemingly grieving the loss of a loved one. Suddenly, one of the inmates barges into the office, threatening the family with a gun, no doubt taken from one of the police officers that was overwhelmed. You notice a pistol lying on a nearby table. The inmate is a large target, it would be hard to miss at this range. Do you take the shot (←) or not (→) ?|4|5|}
4{The inmate crumples, the family jolts back. Your pistol is still smoking when one of the officers takes aim, and fires...|}
5{You leave the station as sneakily as possible, hearing gunshots come from behind you. A few screams ring out, but they quickly fade away. Looks like you’ll continue to live free, or at least until the police catch you again…|}
6{An officer comes to fetch you from your cell to make a deposition. You’ll definitely be charged with manslaughter, they caught you with the crime weapon in hand, that cursed lever. As you walk through the police station hall on your way to the interrogation room, your mind wanders. Will you ever be free again? How long will you have to stay in prison for? You could probably walk away scot free with a good enough lawyer. Do you pay the best lawyer in town (←) or not (→) ?|7|8|}
7{The trial is expeditious. It’s obvious, how could you have been condemned when you clearly saved four lives? The evidence is irrefutable, the jury is unanimous. You are a free man. However, that lawyer cost a pretty penny. Looks like you’ll have to make due with a cardboard bow for the foreseeable future.|}
8{The trial is expeditious. It’s obvious, how could you not be the culprit when the police caught you red handed at the scene of the crime? The evidence is irrefutable, the jury is unanimous. You are a criminal. You better hope the inmates treat you well, because you’re going to stay in that hole for a long while.|}
9{The trolley speeds by, its direction unchanged. Five innocent people lose their lives, but you had nothing to do with it. Your hands are clean; your conscience, however, is another story.|}
